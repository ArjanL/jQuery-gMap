# What is gMap?

gMap is a lightweight [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) plugin that helps you embed Google Maps into your website. With only 2 KB in size it is very flexible and highly customizable.

## What's different from the original?

This fork of the original gMap plugin works with the [Google Maps API V3](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/) which is faster and has better support for mobile devices as well as traditional browsers. This version of the API also has the benefit that it doesn't require an API key, so no more generating keys for development and production.

This version also adds the `gMapCenterAt` and `gMapAddMarker` methods for manipulating the generated maps.

## Example

This tiny line of code is being used to embed the map below. Simple, isn't it?

    $("#map").gMap();

## Different Usage

The `maptype` has to be set as an **string** and can be set to any of these values: `'HYBRID'`, `'TERRAIN'`, `'SATELLITE'` or `'ROADMAP'`.

Added the `shadowanchor` setting to position the shadow properly.

This version no longer uses the `infowindowanchor` setting.

The `control` setting now can be set to `false` for no control or as an Javascript object containing each individual control as a property.

A whole set of options can be set as follows:

	var options = {
		controls: {
            panControl: true,
            zoomControl: true,
            mapTypeControl: true,
            scaleControl: true,
            streetViewControl: true,
            overviewMapControl: true
        },
		scrollwheel: false,
		maptype: 'TERRAIN',
		markers: [
			{
				latitude: -2.2014,
				longitude: -80.9763,
			},
	        {
				address: "Guayaquil, Ecuador",
				html: "My Hometown",
				icon: {
					image: "images/gmap_pin_grey.png",
					iconsize: [26, 46],
					iconanchor: [12,46]
				}
			}
		],
		icon: {
			image: "http://www.google.com/mapfiles/marker.png",
			shadow: "http://www.google.com/mapfiles/shadow50.png",
			iconsize: [20, 34],
			shadowsize: [37, 34],
			iconanchor: [9, 34],
			shadowanchor: [19, 34]
		},
		latitude: -2.282,
		longitude: -80.272,
		zoom: 10
	}
